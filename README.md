# AI-Driven Assessment of Aluminum Wire Rod Properties
A machine learning project to predict tensile strength and elongation of aluminum wire rods.

## Phase 1: Progress
- **Dataset Loaded**: 150+ rows, 19 columns (Alloy code, C, Si, ..., Tensile Strength, Elongation).
- **EDA Completed**: 
  - No missing values.
  - Tensile Strength decreases with temperature.
  - Elongation increases with temperature.
- **Next Steps**: Preprocessing and feature engineering.
